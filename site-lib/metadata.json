think that the calendar design where a year is broken into month has serious flaws. The time goes on and doesn't care about how you slice it. We should stop bringing the constraints of physical objects (mass-produced paper calendars) into digital world, where we can achieve much more.Long time ago I figured that I can create custom continuous calendars for important time intervals and print them out on paper, to write on them. I was doing these from time to time even up until recent years when I discovered Obsidian. And may even still do in specific situations in the future.Naturally, as my system of Obsidian daily notes was evolving, I needed a similar overview of a time window around current day, where I could see on the calendar everything that links to daily notes. Back then (in 2023) I used Dataview plugin. Because of some plugins' UX flaws, I didn't feel like my solution is good enough to recommend to wide audience.Around the same time, I realized I pretty certainly have ADHD. That explains some things about my relation with time, memory and other things. Good visualization is of vital importance to me - putting upcoming and past events on a \"map\" helps to augment memory and time perception with spatial perception...Now, Datacore is available for everyone, and it allows much better ergonomics of created components. So I've rewritten my calendar, with some cleanup and improvements, and can present as something that is easy to adopt and adapt by almost any Obsidian user.Do I see this as a dedicated plugin? A dedicated plugin would be way more rigid compared to a Datacore component that can be modified any time according to shifting personal requirements. The only true organization system is the one that can grow and evolve with you. But I also would be happy to see less of bad calendars, including in plugins, if my creation can show the path to more ergonomic design.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://blacksmithgu.github.io/datacore/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://blacksmithgu.github.io/datacore/\" target=\"_self\">Datacore</a> plugin\nfollowing files placed in the vault: obsidian/datacore/calendarDay.jsx\nobsidian/datacore/calendars.css\nobsidian/datacore/luxonUtils.js\nobsidian/datacore/rollingDayCalendar.jsx\nobsidian/datacore/rollingWeekCalendar.jsx Note: there is currently no way for Datacore components to use relative paths. Paths inside files might need to be edited according to your vault organizational structure if you put them in a different place.Intent: to see few weeks ahead and behind from current (or specified) day.It is like your monthly wall calendar with a room for notes, except you will never be in a situation when tomorrow or yesterday is on another page and can't be seen.And it uses note linking and properties to be a live presentation of all things that you choose to be aware of, without any convoluted vault organization.<br>For each day cell contents see the <a data-href=\"#Calendar day\" href=\"#Calendar_day_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Calendar day</a> section below.How to use:```datacorejsx\nconst { RollingWeekCalendar } = await dc.require(\"obsidian/datacore/rollingWeekCalendar.jsx\"); return function View() { // with all defaults: // return &lt;RollingWeekCalendar /&gt; // with explicit properties: return &lt;RollingWeekCalendar date={\"2025-10-21\"} firstWeekOffset={-2} lastWeekOffset={2} minWeeks={2} maxWeeks={7} weekStart={1} showControls={true} /&gt;\n}\n```\nWhat you get:(Note: it is only interactive when opened in Obsidian. On the web you either see it static or as a code block like above.

individual day.It has following features:\ndate (top left) day of the month\nlinks to the daily note if it exists daily notes are assumed to have the YYYY-MM-DD name format the day (specified day, today by default) - bold month name (top center) only shown for the first day of each month on screen note area (top right) intended to only fit couple emojis - think what makes most sense for you\n📍 if the daily note contains calendarNote property - it will be put here\n📍 if any notes linking to the daily note contain calendarNote property - all will be appended here as well, as links those links won't be put into inlinks list below intent: most common recurring tasks that don't require extra words, to free up the space in inlinks area for anything more special inlinks area links to notes that link to this daily note (regardless of whether the daily note itself exist or not) daily notes of one day before and after are not included pops out on hover to show long titles there is no way to expand outside of the code block though, afaik\nit seems preferable when Page preview setting \"Require Ctrl to trigger on hover\" is enabled - to avoid some screen space occlusion full note paths in tooltips border existing/non-existing daily notes - solid/dashed borders\ntoday - extra outline\n📍 if the daily note or any note linking to it contains calendarColor property - its value will be set as the border color use inlink colors sparingly - there is no way to resolve color conflicts weekday today - more contrast color\nthe weekday (same weekday as specified day) - bold Some CSS classes
